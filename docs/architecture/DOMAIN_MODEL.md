# Ledgerase Domain Model

This document currently defines only the Money concept.

## Money

Money is an immutable value describing an exact signed monetary amount in one
currency. It has no identity beyond its amount and currency.

### Representation and examples

- `amountMinor`: an exact integer count of the currency's minor units. For v0.1,
  use a JavaScript `number` that always satisfies `Number.isSafeInteger(amountMinor)`.
  Never represent Money as fractional major-unit values.
- `currency`: an explicit, validated, uppercase ISO 4217 currency code, such as
  `AUD`. Do not infer currency from a symbol or default it to AUD.

Currency minor-unit scale belongs to currency metadata used for parsing and
formatting. Basic Money arithmetic operates on integer minor units and does not
require that metadata. Two decimal places are not a universal assumption; AUD
uses 100 minor units per dollar.

| Monetary value | amountMinor | currency |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| AUD 12.34 | 1234 | AUD |
| AUD -12.34 | -1234 | AUD |
| AUD 0.00 | 0 | AUD |

### Signs

Money may be positive, negative, or zero. Money itself assigns no inflow/outflow
semantics to these signs. Transaction will define the cash-flow sign convention
later.

### Invariants

- Amount and currency are both required. Negative amounts and zero are valid.
- Amounts and arithmetic results must satisfy `Number.isSafeInteger()`.
  Arithmetic producing a value outside the safe integer range must fail
  explicitly; amounts must never be silently rounded or truncated.
- Invalid or unsupported currency codes must fail explicitly, without
  substitution.
- Addition, subtraction, and ordering require matching currencies. There is no
  implicit conversion or combined total across currencies.
- Zero has one representation per currency; there is no distinct negative zero.

### Equality semantics

Two Money values are equal only when both their signed `amountMinor` and currency
code match. Equality is independent of object identity or display formatting.
1234 minor units in AUD and 1234 minor units in USD are unequal; zero AUD and
zero USD are also unequal.

### Not handled yet

- Exchange rates, currency conversion, or totals across currencies.
- Sub-minor-unit amounts, rounding policies, splitting, or allocation.
- Parsing source text, locale-specific formatting, or source provenance.
- Financial classification, ledger semantics, or other domain models.
- APIs, serialization, or database storage.

### Open questions

Before implementation, decide:

- Which currencies will v0.1 accept, and where will validated minor-unit scale
  metadata come from?
